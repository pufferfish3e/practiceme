# PracticeMe Automation Tool

## Project Info

This project automates answering single-player practice questions on [PracticeMe](https://practiceme.vercel.app/).

It uses [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/) for web automation, allowing it to interact with the browser like a human user.

Additionally, the project integrates the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to evaluate and interpret simple [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) code dynamically.

Gemini is not good at solving the following problem types:
- Index Operations
- For Loops
- While Loops
- Function Parameters
- Arithmetic Precedence
- Post/Pre In/Decrement
- Switch
- Do...While

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3

```

## 3. Get a Gemini API Key

Visit [Google's Gemini API page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and generate a key.

## 4. Update your settings.py file

Replace placeholder values with your actual iChat email, password, and Gemini API key.

```python

```

There are additional settings that can be configured within the ```bash settings.py``` file.
